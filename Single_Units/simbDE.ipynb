The name of each species together with the names of the kinetic variables are converted to a sympy class. This class allows to manipulate each variable in a simbolic way. Also, the way how the reactions take place and the species interact with each other is represented by the reagent and product matrices. The first one represents the count for every species while it is performing as a reagent. In the other hand, the product matrix represents the count for every species while it is performing as a product. In both matrices, each reaction is reprenseted as a column, while each species is a row from the matrices."
