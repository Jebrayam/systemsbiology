# Single Units Implementation

In this folder are every function implemented for the project. Here, it is possible to download and run each function individually. Each function has its own brief explanation and commend related to the implementation. 
Some of the functions depend on others to run correctly, so the *simsysbio.py* file is required to be in the same directory path.

The implemented functions to this project are the next:
- **simbDE**. Determine simbolically the set of diferrential equations that describe the system output.
