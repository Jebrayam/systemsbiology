# Gene Expression Simulator (GenExpSim)
This project was developed in order to help people interested in learn about modeling of gene expression in cell populations. GenExpSim is an informatic tool (desktop application)
created to learn or teach some topics about Systems Biology (Gene Expression). The tool is programmed in Python 3.7.4. One of the reasons why it's based on that programming 
language is to make sure that anyone could get access to the tool and if it is the case one could modify or improve it.
